# Cafeteria-Recharge-System
Integrated Project 2018

# Description
The purpose of this project was to develop an effective working system which can take
the order and print the invoice and help reduce the workload and queues that are present
every day. During peak hours, the student crowd is so huge that it becomes very difficult
to get an order placed and have that food in the limited break time. Cafeteria ordering and
recharge system enables the students to get their online recharge done and order placed easily
with this system and they just have to collect the order thereby by showing their transactions.

# Implementation

- The Firebase Realtime Database is used to store data in JSON format. The database is
  synchronized on realtime to every connected client.
- Users can login/signup in the website and make orders and a invoice will be
  generated with the order summary.
- All languages have been learnt from scratch and it has been implemented.
- The main aim of the website is to use the realtime database to create a fully
  functional ordering application keeping in mind the final aim of reducing the recharge
  queues in Colleges/Universities.
